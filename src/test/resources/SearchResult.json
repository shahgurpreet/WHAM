Decompression is a community effort, which means that the work and talent of any one individual is considered no greater than that of any other individual. We do not have headliners or art superstars - all who attend are considered participants and as such are expected to contribute what they can, financially as well as artistically. That said, we do acknowledge that not all participants are able to contribute financially to the same extent. To address that, we offer a lower-priced ticket option for artists, performers and volunteers who apply for one. \n  \nIf you need a lower-priced ticket, and are an artist, performer, or (both pre- and post-event) volunteer for Boston Decompression 2015, 2014, and/or 2013 - please email tickets@blackrockeast.com with your full name and list your contribution. You will receive a unique promotional code for one ticket at $12 (+ a small ticketing fee.) This option will be not be available at the door - it is only for pre-sale tickets.  \n We urge those who are able to please continue paying full ticket price, as revenue from ticket sales is what defrays the cost of Decompression. Our goal is that none of the event organizers will be required to use their personal resources to fund Decompression. \u00a0 \n\u00a0 \nFAQs \n\u00a0 \nWhere can I contact the organizer with any questions? \ninfo@blackrockeast.com \n\u00a0 \n\u00a0 \nFAQs \n\u00a0 \nAre there ID requirements or an age limit to enter the event? \nThis event is 21+. Bring your ID.  \n\u00a0 \nDo I have to bring my printed ticket to the event? \nNo, you may bring a printed ticket or present the ticket on your phone - the QR code on your ticket will be scanned on entry.  \n\u00a0 ",

Decompression is a community effort, which means that the work and talent of any one individual is considered no greater than that of any other individual. We do not have headliners or art superstars - all who attend are considered participants and as such are expected to contribute what they can, financially as well as artistically. That said, we do acknowledge that not all participants are able to contribute financially to the same extent. To address that, we offer a lower-priced ticket option for artists, performers and volunteers who apply for one.<\/SPAN><\/P>\r\n<P DIR=\"ltr\" STYLE=\"line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><SPAN STYLE=\"color: #666699;\"><BR><\/SPAN><\/P>\r\n<P DIR=\"ltr\" STYLE=\"line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><SPAN STYLE=\"color: #666699;\"><SPAN STYLE=\"font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">If you need a lower-priced ticket, and are an artist, performer, or (both pre- and post-event) volunteer for Boston Decompression 2015, 2014, and/or 2013 - please email <\/SPAN><A STYLE=\"text-decoration: none;\" HREF=\"mailto:tickets@blackrockeast.com\" REL=\"nofollow\"><SPAN STYLE=\"font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: #666699; text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">tickets@blackrockeast.com<\/SPAN><\/A><SPAN STYLE=\"font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"> with your full name and list your contribution.
